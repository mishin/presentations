<pre>                                       Chef Model: providers
     
     For example, given a resource such as:
     
       directory &quot;/tmp/monkey&quot; do
         owner &quot;root&quot;
         group &quot;root&quot;
         mode 0755
         action :create
       end
     
     This would:
     * Look up the provider for a directory resource: Chef::Provider::Directory
     * Call load_current_resource, which creates a new directory[&quot;/tmp/monkey&quot;] resource, 
       based on the directories current state (which goes in @current_resource).
     * Call action_create, which is responsible making sure the directory exists, 
       and that it's attributes are correct.
     * If we changed the directory in any way, we mark the resource as updated.
</pre>
