<pre>                                        Chef Model: recipies
     &quot;Recipes are the fundamental configuration in Chef. 
      Recipes encapsulate collections of resources which are 
      executed in the order defined to configure the system&quot;
     http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Recipes
     
     Basic Rules:
       0. Recipes are stored in Cookbooks.
       1. executed in the order they appear.
       2. evaluated as Ruby code on the node, to find resources to execute. 
       3. Recipes from other Cookbooks can be included with include_recipe.
       4. All the attributes of the current Node are available via the node object.
       5. namespaced by cookbook::recipie
