<pre>                                       Chef Model: providers
     
     Providers take a resource, compare that resource to the current state of the part 
     of the system it is managing, and then takes the Action specified in the resource.
     They are the way that Chef supports multiple platforms with a single Resource.
     
     http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Providers
     
     * heavy lifting to configure resources, based on the platform of the node. 
     * idempotent actions to configure a resource as it is declared in the recipe.
     * generally written by the Chef team.  
       * build your own using LWRP (Light Weight Resources and Providers)
